# Explainable-XAI-BreastCancerDetection_CNN

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes ofcancer-related deaths among women. Therefore, accuratemulti-class grading of histopathological images is crucial forearly screening and effective treatment of breast cancer. Giventhe large amount of intra-class variation and inter-classsimilarity, traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)frequently struggle in multi-class grading. To mitigate thesechallenges, we present MSHFF-Net, an Explainable Multi-ScaleHierarchical Feature Fusion architecture that combinesadaptive multi-scale blocks with a feature-fusion stem tosimultaneously capture tissue-level patterns and fine-grainedcellular structures. The model processes input images of size320×320, preserving spatial resolution to enable detailed featureextraction. MSHFF-Net is trained on the publicly availableBRACS benchmark dataset using Leaky ReLU activation andsparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. It achieves anoverall accuracy of 73.94%, outperforming several state-of-the-art CNN backbones. These results demonstrate the effectivenessof hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion in enhancingautomated breast cancer diagnosis from histopathologicalimages. Furthermore, to ensure interpretability, theExplainable AI (XAI) method Gradient-Weighted ClassActivation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is employed to visualize thedecision-making process of MSHFF-Net, providing greatertransparency and clinical trustworthiness.
